"""NV3007 142x428 SPI LCD driver — host-side, bridge-agnostic.

This is a faithful Python port of the production wallet firmware's NV3007
bring-up (the firmware itself is not included in this skill). It exists so a
designer with only a USB-to-SPI bridge (no STM32 dev board) can push pixels to
the real EastRising ER-TFTM1.65-2 panel and iterate on UI visuals.

Nothing in this file is specific to the USB bridge. All bus access goes
through a :class:`Transport` — implement one per bridge (see ``ch347.py``).
The two panel-facing operations a backend must provide are:

    command(cmd, params)  -> one CS-low window, DC=0 for the command byte
                             then DC=1 for the parameter bytes (the NV3007
                             resets its parameter index on CS-high, so a
                             command and its params MUST share one CS window)
    pixels(data)          -> one CS-low window, DC=1, stream RGB565 bytes

Panel facts (from the ER-TFTM1.65-2 / NV3007 datasheets + the firmware):
  * 142(W) x 428(H) native, IPS, NV3007 controller, 4-wire 8-bit SPI.
  * SPI mode 0 (CPOL=0, CPHA=0), MSB-first, 8-bit.
  * RGB565, big-endian on the wire (high byte first).
  * CASET/RASET carry a +12 X offset (RAM is wider than the visible window).
  * 3.3 V logic; VCC 3.0/3.3/3.5 V; module current <= 60 mA.
  * RES active-low: firmware ties it to 3.3 V and uses SWRESET (0x01).
  * BLK is a logic-level backlight enable (High = on): tie to 3.3 V.
